# Chapter 1: Dark Schemes

Augustus Larkin, and his "personal aid" Luis de Mendoza, sought out explorers/archeologists/financiers for his expedetion to locate a lost civilization in Peru. The ragtag group met in Lima, and were introduced to Jackson Elias (AKA Jessie Hughs), a published writer out of New York City, and Assistant Professor Eleanor Butler, a history professor from Miskatonic University.

The group soon learns that not everything is as it seems, and the hints of the kharisiri "vampires" are running rampant through the local area and of an *El Padre de los Gusados* or "Father of Maggots" seems to slowly bubble to the top of the rumor mill. Are Vampires even real? 

Confronting Larkin and Mendoza at a lost pyramid near Lake Titicaca, a fierce battle rages between the two groups. Unfortunately, Sadie Winchester, the meta-physical practitioner from New York, is lost to madness and kills herself, possibly keeping *El Padre de los Gusados* from inhabiting a host and freeing the "Father of Maggots" onto the world. 

As the dust settles, Mendoza and the other "vampires" were turned to ash, and Larkin, being gravely injured during the fight, seems to have vanished.

# USING LUCK

### Adjusting Skill or Characteristic Rolls

Cost: 1 for 1 basis

After the player has made a skill roll (using a skill or characteristic), Luck points may be spent to alter the result. The player can use Luck points to alter a roll on a 1 for 1 basis. The amount of Luck points that cna be spent in this manner is limited only by the character's available Luck score.

### Adjusting Weapon Fumble or Firearm Malfunction Outcomes

Cost: 10 Luck

When a roll indicates a melee weapon fumble or a firearms malfunciton, 10 Luck points may be spent to ignore the result. The actual die roll result is not adjusted and the attack is still a failure. Luck is spent to avoid the dire consequences of the roll, allowing the hero to avoid a wepoan breaking or a firearm jamming, and so on. 

### Halving Sanity Loss

Cost: double the Sanity points loss

When a Sanity roll has been failed, the number of Sanity points lost may be halved by spending Luck points equal to double the Sanity loss. For example, a hero is about to lose 8 Sanity points from seeing a horror from beyond. The hero spends 16 Luck points in total, reducing the loss from 8 to 4 points. 

### Avoiding Unconciousness

Cost: 1 Luck point, doubles each round thereafter

Whenever a hero fails a CON roll to remain concious, or if they suffer automatic unconciousness, they may spend 1 Luck point to remain concious until the end of the current round. For each successive round thereafter that the hero wishes to remain conscious, the cost doubles -2, 4, 8, 16, and so on- and should be spent at the start fo each round.

As soon as their Luck points run out or if they no longer wish to spend Luck, they immediately fall unconscious. This is a mixed blessing, as an active character may present a more attractive target for further damage.

### It's Only a Scratch!

Cost: 20 Luck

Wounds can sometimes look a lot worse than they actually are. Pulp heroes are able to call upon their inner reserves and gain an instant health boost to reduce damage damage they have received. When damage has been taken, a hero may spend 20 Luck points to gain an immediate 1d6 hit points recovery. Hit Points gained may not exceed the hero's maximum hit points total. 

In some situations, this may bring a hero back from the brink of death or simply give them an adrenaline rush to shake off their injuries and get on with the job in hand. The Keeper may also allow this health gain to provide faster recovery for a severely injured hero. 

### Avoiding Certain Death

Cost: all Luck points, 30 points minimum spend required

If a hero has 30+ Luck points remaining, all of these Luck points may be spent to bring a hero back form the brink of death. The hero has avoided certain death and immediately regains 1d6+1 hit points, turning up in the next scene in an appropriate state.

# LUCK RECOVERY

At the start of each session of play, each player makes a Luck Recovery roll. This is roplled in the same way as for normal skill improvement. The player rolls 1d100 and if the roll is higher than their current Luck score they add 2d10+10 points to their Luck score. IF the roll is equal to or lessthan the hero's present Lucj score, 1d10+5 Luck points are recovered. 

Naturally, a hero's Luck score will vary throughout play, but may never exceed 99. The starting Luck value is not used again in the game and can be exceeded in the course of play.

# CRITICAL SUCCESSES AND FUMBLES

A critical success only arises from a natural dice roll of "01." Should Luck points be used to lower a roll to 01 the result is always an Extreme success, rather than a critical one. The only exception to this would be in combat where two opponents have tied, both scoring Extreme success, if one uses Luck to lower their ocmbat roll to"01" it means thay they beat their opponent's level of success, treat the result as an Extreme success though. 

As with standard *Call of Cthulhu*, a naturally rolled critical success always means something beneficial has happened, determined by the Keeper and the situation at hand. Likewise, a natural fumble, or "100", means something bad has happened. Note thaty while Luck can be used to avoid the effects of a fumble or malfunction in combat, for non-combat skills a natural fumble cannot be avoided!
