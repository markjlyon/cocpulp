Known for their blend of traditional honor and modern illicit operations, they are deeply involved in smuggling, extortion, data theft, and black-market cyberware, all while maintaining a complex relationship with local government and corporate interests.

     Rika Tanaka, “The Silk Widow”, Cultural Operations Lieutenant 
     The Silk Widow moves like a brand ambassador for the underworld — all sculpted grace in spiderweave suits and iridescent eyes, her every word measured, her silences sharper than threats.

     Aiko – “Neon Blossom”, Mainstream Pop Idol

## The Law

Lone Star

Lone Star in Puyallup maintains law and order with a corporate-backed focus, making them a polarizing force in the district. While they may provide a visible presence in policing, their ties to the megacorps and their brutal enforcement tactics have made them one of the least trusted entities among the local populace. Their reliance on heavy-handed tactics and lack of genuine concern for the district’s disadvantaged citizens creates a tense atmosphere, where they are seen as an arm of corporate oppression rather than a true protector of the people.

     Commander Valerie Holt – Commander of Lone Star Puyallup Division

     Sergeant Alex “Slick” Roderick – Field Operations and Tactical Coordination

     Captain Layla Mercer – Public Relations and Community Outreach

Knight Errant

Knights Errant in Puyallup operates as a corporate-backed security force focused on maintaining order, but their close ties to megacorporations make them deeply distrusted by the local populace. While their leadership is pragmatic and their tactics effective in controlling high-crime areas, they are often seen as enforcers of corporate interests, which fuels resentment, particularly among lower-class residents, activists, and criminal groups. Their divisions, from elite tactical teams to intelligence and surveillance units, are feared for their overwhelming force and invasive presence. Despite attempts at public relations, Knights Errant remains an oppressive force to many, upholding corporate power at the expense of the district's marginalized communities.

     Commander Selene Rourke – Commander of Knights Errant Puyallup Division

     Lieutenant Marcus Trent – Operations Coordinator

     Captain Elle Stryker – Corporate Relations and Public Affairs Officer

The Steel Maw Collective is a ruthless, cyber-enhanced street gang specializing in corporate espionage, data theft, and infiltration, operating under a strict hierarchy where lower-tier members are pushed to prove their worth through dangerous and degrading missions.

     Leader: Maxim “The Maw” Volkov — “The Apex Grinder”
     A towering brute wrapped in chrome and blood-rusted steel, Maxim is infamous for his crushing cybernetic jaw and ruthless hunger for control.

     Underboss: Silvia “Circuit Queen” Tran — “The Glitch Regent”
     Cold as liquid nitrogen and sharper than monowire, Silvia bends code and people alike with ruthless precision.

     The Iron Claw (Elite Enforcers)

     The Mouths (Middle-tier Members): Grit — “The Pavement Butcher”
     A war-torn ex-merc, built like a dumpster full of guns and bad decisions, whose first reaction to a problem is to crush it into meat.

     The Pupils (Lower-tier Members / New Recruits)
     Fade

# Fort Lewis

# PUYALLUP

The Puyallup District is a war-torn, industrial wasteland of decaying high-rises, toxic air, and gang-riddled streets, where the powerful megacorps turn a blind eye to the suffering of the masses. From the gritty, desperate corners of Carbonado and Loveland to the corporate-controlled heart of Puyallup City, the district is a hotbed of criminal activity, militarized control, and those seeking to survive or exploit the chaos. Amid the ruins, pockets of resistance and hope—like Petrowski Farms—struggle to offer a better life, though it often feels like a fleeting dream.

## Puyallup City, Puyallup

Puyallup City is the crumbling heart of the Puyallup District, a forgotten urban sprawl ruled by a corrupt and decaying local government under Mayor Roy “King Smoke” Olmstead. Despite the overwhelming influence of organized crime and megacorporate interests, the city remains a battleground for survival, with the mayor’s iron-fisted rule barely maintaining order amid the chaos.

### The Ember Spire — City Hall & Mayoral Complex

Operator: Mayor Roy “King Smoke” Olmstead

An ominous neo-gothic tower that looms over central Puyallup, The Ember Spire houses the offices of the Mayor, Deputy Mayor, and top-tier administration. Black mirrored windows and crimson lighting give the tower its nickname. Inside, the structure is a blend of corporate chic and ceremonial grandiosity — all designed to intimidate visitors and assert control.

Security is handled by corporate-trained private guards and an AI threat assessment system that constantly scans for “deviant behavior.” Dissenters often find themselves “redirected” before ever stepping through the grand lobby.

Tension: Protesters frequently gather outside the barricaded square, while rumors swirl about a hidden sublevel where classified meetings occur between Olmstead and corporate stakeholders. Few leave that floor unchanged.

Special Feature: The Red Vault — A hidden sub-basement archive housing sensitive blackmail files, corporate contracts, and illicit secrets. Access is strictly limited, but whispered about by info brokers and fixers across the city.

### The Chromium Grid — District Surveillance Control Center

Operator: Director Gerald “Watchdog” Dovetail

A sleek, low-profile monolith buried under a former transit terminal, The Chromium Grid is the nerve center of Puyallup’s surveillance network. Inside, banks of holographic displays project live feeds from thousands of drones, cams, and cybernetic informants throughout the district.

This is where Dovetail's operatives monitor all digital and physical movement across the city — flagging threats, blacklisting individuals, and "correcting" patterns deemed disruptive.

Tension: Activist hackers constantly attempt to breach the Grid's firewalls, while rogue deckers suspect an untraceable sub-AI is influencing decisions with an unknown agenda.

Special Feature: The Mirror Room — A predictive analytics suite powered by stolen DNI data and quantum cognition nodes. It supposedly generates “threat oracles” about future public behavior — or targeted political opponents.

### The Slatehouse — Department of Urban Development
Operator: Claudia “Brick” Voss

Built atop the ruins of an old industrial office block, The Slatehouse is a brutalist slab of concrete and glass that reflects its architect’s no-nonsense ethos. Voss's operatives coordinate zoning changes, corporate construction bids, and public works — often with little regard for displaced residents.

It is the beating heart of Puyallup’s transformation from slum to segmented corporate playground, churning out contracts that pave over communities.

Tension: Slumlords, protest groups, and neighborhood elders frequently petition or infiltrate The Slatehouse, trying to slow the tide of gentrification. Most are stonewalled, but some make... arrangements.

Special Feature: The Future Room — A scale-model holographic map of the entire district. Rumor says key pieces light up with current corporate interest or active redevelopment threats, allowing insight into what's coming next.

### The Obsidian Archive — Bureau of Records & Intelligence Affairs

Operator: Chief of Staff Terrence “Terry” Bishop

An old pre-Crash data vault buried beneath the city’s first courthouse, The Obsidian Archive contains sensitive city records, ancestral land deeds, and the digital remnants of long-forgotten scandals. Bishop runs it quietly, using the info within to twist arms and make deals before opposition can organize.

It is not open to the public.

Tension: Archive workers often disappear without explanation, and rumor holds that the lower levels are “cursed” — riddled with rogue code and data-phantoms that whisper secrets not meant to be known.

Special Feature: Echo Subnet — An underground AI librarian interface corrupted by black ICE long ago. If approached respectfully, it can still answer questions — but it always demands a secret in return.

### The Green Veil — Environmental Affairs Field Office
Operator: Miranda “Green” Cho

A heavily fortified greenhouse and monitoring station set up within a toxic industrial exclusion zone, The Green Veil serves as a combination lab, sanctuary, and staging ground for environmental reclamation missions.

Cho and her team work amid polluted air, mutated plantlife, and occasional sabotage from industries that don’t want environmental regulation. The building itself is overgrown with vine-covered steel plating and powered by unstable green tech prototypes.

Tension: Corp-backed black ops occasionally target the Veil’s experimental data, while local scavengers seek to loot its tech. Eco-terrorists sometimes shelter here — or worse, infiltrate it.

Special Feature: Seed Vault Alpha — A cryogenic vault storing engineered flora that could, under the right conditions, detoxify entire districts — or render them uninhabitable to anything not bio-adapted.

### Crime Mall, Puyallup City, Puyallup

Operator: Various low-tier fixers, gang leaders, and corporate off-the-books suppliers.

A sprawling, decrepit megamall beneath the ruins of Puyallup City’s once-prosperous downtown, the Crime Mall is a labyrinthine den of illegal trade, shadowy deals, and dangerous alliances. Originally built as a high-end shopping center, it now serves as a massive black-market hub for all things illicit: stolen goods, weaponry, drugs, illegal cyberware, and counterfeit IDs. The mall’s floors are crammed with everything from shadow-tech to smuggled goods, and it’s the go-to location for anyone looking to operate under the radar.

Tension: Vendors are often at odds, and conflicts can escalate into all-out shootouts or sabotage, especially if someone crosses the wrong dealer or gang.

### The Hollow Halls — Hidden Sanctuary & Forgotten District

Operator: The Silent Watcher, a mysterious figure whose true identity is known only to a select few.

Tucked beneath the decaying foundations of Puyallup City, The Hollow Halls is a labyrinth of ancient, long-forgotten tunnels and chambers that have been repurposed by those who live in the shadows of the district. The area serves as a sanctuary for those rejected by society, a place where the outcasts can find shelter, respite, and a grim sense of community. The Hollow Halls are an eerie, dimly-lit maze of narrow corridors, hidden alcoves, and abandoned infrastructure, where whispers of strange rituals and the unspoken bonds of survival fill the air. Some come seeking refuge from the harsh world above, while others find themselves drawn to the dark promise of hidden knowledge, power, or immortality.

Tension: The Hollow Halls are a place where survival is paramount, and resources are scarce. Those who reside here are deeply territorial, and alliances can shift in the blink of an eye as the desperate struggle to maintain their place in this subterranean world. The only law here is the unspoken one: trust is fleeting, and betrayal is common. Outsiders who venture too deep into the Hollow Halls may find themselves unable to leave—or worse, caught up in the underground community’s secretive dealings.

Special Feature: The Deep Chambers—a vast network of cavernous rooms, once used for long-abandoned infrastructure projects—now house some of the Hollow Halls' most enigmatic residents. The inhabitants of these chambers have a peculiar and unsettling nature, and rumors swirl about their rituals, their strange practices, and the enigmatic beings they serve. No one quite knows what happens beyond the veiled entrances to these hidden depths, but the very walls seem to whisper of hunger, transformation, and a desperate need to replenish what has been lost.

## Wastes, Puyallup

The Wastes of Puyallup are a desolate expanse of ruined industrial zones, toxic wastelands, and urban decay, where survival is a constant struggle. Home to a mix of gang-controlled neighborhoods, toxic zones, and corporate interests, it’s a district where the powerless live in squalor under the watchful eyes of megacorps, corrupt politicians, and brutal organized crime syndicates. Despite the bleakness, pockets of resistance, like Petrowski Farms, offer a glimmer of hope in an otherwise lawless and oppressive landscape.

### The Rustforge Hall — Dwarven Clan Forge & Gathering Hall

Operator: Borgan "Stonefury" Thrainar, a veteran war-forger with a deep respect for tradition and an unyielding sense of clan loyalty.

Description: The Rustforge Hall is the heart of the dwarven community in the Black Junk Yards, where the clang of hammer on steel echoes day and night. It's a massive subterranean forge built deep into the scrap, where dwarven artisans create everything from weapons and armor to intricate mechanical devices. The air is thick with the heat of molten metal, and the walls are lined with the scarred remnants of past battles, tools, and war machines, all repurposed into something new and functional. Borgan "Stonefury" Thrainar, the hall’s master forger, leads the operation with an iron fist, ensuring that each piece forged is crafted with honor and precision. The forge is a symbol of dwarven resilience, where raw, often discarded materials are turned into functional works of art that have both utility and soul.

Tension: The Rustforge Hall is a place of hard work, but also simmering tension. Rivalry exists between the dwarven clans over trade and forging rights, with Borgan caught in a delicate balance between maintaining tradition and adapting to the desperate realities of the junkyards. Outsiders come here seeking custom-made weaponry or mechanical parts, but often find themselves entangled in the dwarves' internal politics and power struggles.

Special Feature: The Forge Pit at the heart of the hall is said to be enchanted with ancient dwarven runes, imbuing the weapons and armor made here with a sense of indestructibility. It's a coveted place, and only the most trusted dwarven smiths are allowed to work on it. Those who prove themselves worthy are granted the right to forge in the Pit, but those who fail to live up to the standards are ostracized or worse.

## Loveland, Puyallup

Loveland is a neon-lit playground for the desperate and the privileged alike, blending brothels, nightclubs, and illegal entertainment with a dark underbelly of gang wars, corporate intrigue, and black-market dealings. Military personnel from Fort Lewis mingle with shadowrunners and mercs, all navigating a chaotic world where pleasure, survival, and secrets are bought and sold under the flickering lights of vice.

### Quinn’s — Underground Fight Club & Bar

Owner: Quinn “The Hammer” Reyes, ex-military with a penchant for brutal, no-rules combat.

An illegal fight pit beneath an abandoned warehouse, where mercs, gangsters, and soldiers come to bet and brawl for pride or cash. The air is thick with sweat, blood, and cigarette smoke.

Specialty: Occasional “Shadowrun” bouts with augmented fighters, often used by gangs to recruit muscle or settle scores.

### The Spirit Focus — Mystic Supply & Occult Lounge

Proprietor: Kira Mendoza, a half-elf adept with ties to the Nithrondar.

This shop doubles as a discreet meeting place for magic users, offering rare reagents, ritual tools, and spirit summoning services. The lounge upstairs serves infused teas and hosts secret magical dueling tournaments.

Vibe: Dim lighting, incense smoke, with whispered chants echoing late into the night.

### The Bishop's Curse — A High-End Speakeasy & Information Broker’s Den

Owner: “The Bishop,” a shadowy info broker rumored to have ties to Vecchio Braccio.

Known for exclusivity and discretion, only those invited can enter. Inside, whisper networks operate amidst top-shelf drinks, and deals involving data, artifacts, and secrets are struck.

Atmosphere: Gothic architecture meets modern cyberpunk luxury; stained glass, soft jazz, and ever-watchful cameras.

### The Armadillo — Dive Bar & Fixer’s Outpost

Owner: Marta “Ironpaw” Delgado, ex-gang enforcer turned fixer.

A chaotic but reliable place where runners and fixers gather. Rough crowd, cheap booze, and a steady flow of jobs posted on the “wall.” Marta is known for never screwing her clients and keeping the peace.

Highlight: A hidden backroom with access to a commlink jammer for sensitive meetups.

### Kenston Aircraft Interiors — Black Market Tech Workshop

Manager: Samir “Patch” Kenston, former aircraft mechanic and shadowrunner tech specialist.

Not a legitimate business, but a high-tech underground workshop specializing in smuggling and modifying aerial drones, cybernetic limbs, and stealth tech for shadowrunners and criminals.

Reputation: Quality work, but beware the price and hidden agendas.

### Loveland Bump & Sleep — Hourly Room Hotel & Clinic

Owner: Dr. Harold “Doc” Jennings, an ethically questionable cyber-doc.

Popular with mercs needing quick rest and repair, the hotel offers hourly rooms plus discreet medical treatment, cyberware upgrades, and “stress relief” therapies.

Risk: Doc sometimes tests experimental procedures on patients without full consent.

### The Good Samaritan Hotel — Medical Haven & Experimental Research Facility

Owner: Dr. Alana "Doc" Greaves, a charismatic and morally ambiguous ex-corporate physician turned underground practitioner.

A modest but high-tech hotel that caters to the underbelly of Puyallup City, offering not just basic accommodations, but also access to experimental medical procedures. The Good Samaritan is a sanctuary for those in desperate need of medical care, from cybernetics to trauma recovery, where the poor and downtrodden can find help—for a price. However, beneath the surface, the hotel serves as a front for a shadow research operation under the guise of providing aid to the community. Some patients come here seeking life-saving care, while others, unaware of the truth, find themselves subjects in highly questionable medical trials and data collection experiments.

Danger: While the hotel’s rooms and services seem to be above board, many of its treatments come with dangerous side effects, and the cost can sometimes include more than just credits. A few individuals have disappeared after undergoing procedures, and whispers of illicit deals with unknown corporate interests abound. Guests need to keep their eyes open and their wits about them, as those seeking experimental treatments might find themselves unable to leave without owing more than they bargained for.

Special Feature: The R&D Wing—hidden in the lower levels of the hotel—is rumored to contain private labs and specialized medical tech where groundbreaking (and highly questionable) research takes place. Most clients aren't told exactly what procedures they’ll be undergoing, and only the most desperate (or most lucrative) patients are allowed access. It’s a place where deals are struck in whispers, and the line between help and exploitation is blurred.

### Terrible Taps — Sports Bar & Braindance Sports Arena

Owner: Gina “G-Unit” Cruz, ex-ganger turned legit entrepreneur.

Highlight: A holographic jukebox with “old-world” funk and hip-hop tunes.

### The Big ‘O’ — Massive Open-Air Night Market

Organizer: Local coalition of orc and goblin street vendors and small-time fixers.

A sprawling night market offering exotic foods, illegal tech, magical trinkets, and street performances. The market is a melting pot of cultures, smells, and shadow deals.

Security: Tight but flexible enforcement by a mix of gang members and mercenary contractors.

### The Iron Lotus — Braindance Club & Lounge

Owner: Reika Mendoza, a former merc with ties to the The Red Rain Syndicate.

A popular spot for military personnel to unwind in immersive braindance experiences ranging from high-action war simulations to deeply illicit sensual VR. Known for discrete private rooms and underground deals.

Specialty: Exotic braindance sessions mimicking Fort Lewis combat scenarios, tailored for soldiers looking to relive or escape battlefield stress.

### The Black Siren — Brothel and Gentlemen’s Club

Owner: Madame Celestina “Cece” Marquez, an influential figure rumored to have a neural link to the Jinmu Family.

High-end brothel catering to military brass, corporate fixers, and shadowrunners. The Black Siren offers everything from traditional companionship to magical enhancement sessions (legal gray area).

Vibe: Velvet curtains, whispering secrets, and discrete back rooms with a reputation for high discretion.

### Fortress Bar & Grill

Owner: Retired Army vet turned entrepreneur, Hank “Grizzly” Lawson.

A raucous, no-frills bar favored by soldiers and mercs, featuring strong drinks, hearty meals, and frequent impromptu brawls. Military patches decorate the walls, and the jukebox spins classic tunes alongside synthwave.

Highlight: Weekly “Ranger’s Night” with discounted drinks and gun maintenance workshops.

### The Neon Reaper — Dive Bar & Fixer Hub

Run by an ex-ganger with connections to the Shotozumi-gumi, this grimy dive bar doubles as a shadowrunner meeting point and a place to pick up off-the-books jobs.

Atmosphere: Low lights, heavy smoke, and a constant hum of whispered deals.

### Hotel Memento — Budget Hotel and Clinic

Owned by a small consortium of former corporate medtech specialists, Hotel Memento provides cheap lodging and basic medical care, including cyberware installs and emergency trauma treatment. Popular with mercs needing quick fixes between jobs.

Hidden Feature: An illegal backdoor VR clinic offering experimental therapies, some involving neurological hacking—sometimes with unexpected side effects.

### Cielo’s Kitchen — Latin Fusion Restaurant

Owned by a charismatic orc chef, Cielo Hernandez, the restaurant is a local favorite for hearty meals blending traditional Latin spices with Puyallup’s rough ingredients. Often a front for discreet meetings among the local orc clans.

Signature Dish: Spicy blood sausage with ash-roasted root vegetables.

## Carbonado, Puyallup

### The Rust Maw — Scavver Stronghold & Forge

Leader: Ghorash “Ironjaw” Krug, a hulking orc blacksmith with a missing jaw replaced by crude mech-tooth plates.

The Rust Maw is an immense scrapyard fortress built from rusted containers, crashed drones, and old car hulks. It’s both home and workshop for scavvers who strip tech and metal from Seattle’s wasteland.

Vibe: The smell of oil and burnt metal; constant hammering and grinding noises. The air buzzes with wild techno beats mixed with guttural war chants.

Reputation: The place to get hard-to-find mods, jury-rigged weapons, and barely legal gear—but expect to pay in blood or favors.

### Bonebreaker Saloon — Orcish Dive & Meeting Hall

Owner: Torga “Bonecrusher” Valka, an aggressive orc veteran with a scarred face and booming laugh.

A smoke-filled den where orcs, goblins, and rough mercs drink cheap liquor and settle disputes with fists or blades. The walls are covered in trophies—broken weapons, trophies from gang fights, and faded war posters.

Highlight: The weekly “Crush and Bash” fight nights draw huge crowds and serve as informal clan recruitment drives.

### The Grotto — Goblin-run Black Market & Fixer Hub

Proprietor: Snikkit “Sharpfang” Vez, a twitchy but clever goblin with augmented eyes that glow red.

Hidden beneath a crumbling apartment complex, The Grotto is a maze of stalls selling illegal cyberware, magical charms, and stolen corporate data. It’s the primary source for gear in Carbonado, but also a den of double-crossers and informants.

Danger: Always watch your back, and don’t linger if you’re not buying.

### Iron Veins Clinic — Underground Medbay & Cyberware Shop

Doc: Magda “Steelheart” Salazar, an orc surgeon with a no-nonsense attitude and a cybernetic right arm.

A rough but highly skilled clinic offering cyberware installation, black market bioware, and emergency trauma care. Magda’s specialty is battlefield salvage and patchwork enhancements that keep the worst cases alive.

Warning: Medical bills can be paid in blood or barter—Magda doesn’t mess around.

### Scrapline Express — Cargo Tram & Smuggling Route

Operator: Various shadowy smugglers with ties to local gangs and megacorps.

A semi-abandoned cargo tram system running through Carbonado’s scrapyards and industrial ruins. Used for moving illicit goods, stolen tech, and occasionally people. The trams are a hotbed of ambushes, secret deals, and corporate surveillance.

Tension: Gangs fight for control of the tram routes; runners using it risk getting caught in turf wars.

### Bloodroot Yard — Clan War Memorial & Ritual Grounds

Caretaker: Elder orc shaman Zuggoth “Bonebinder,” keeper of ancestral rites.

A sacred space amidst the junk and rubble, where Carbonado’s orc clans perform rites of passage, honor fallen warriors, and invoke their spirits for strength.

Atmosphere: Bone altars, warpainted stones, and flickering spirit fires illuminate the night. Outsiders beware—this is holy ground.

### The Scrapper’s Pit — Fight Arena & Clan Trial Zone

Promoter: Korga “The Mauler” Zhal, an orc with a reputation for brutality and fairness.

A brutal open-air pit where conflicts are settled by combat and orcs prove their worth. The fights are vicious and often deadly, with spectators betting on outcomes and clans vying for dominance.

## Petrowski Farms, Puyallup

Petrowski Farms is a rare oasis of stability and hope amidst the chaos of the Puyallup District, offering both sustenance and a sense of community to the struggling masses. Nestled in the otherwise bleak landscape, the farm is a self-sustaining refuge, producing food and goods for the district while providing work and opportunity for locals looking to escape the violence of the streets. Led by the resilient Petrowski family, the farm is known for its strong sense of solidarity and its commitment to helping others, making it one of the few places in the district where genuine change feels possible, though it is constantly under pressure from local gangs, corporate interests, and the harsh realities of the barrens.

## Tarislar "Rememberence", Puyallup

Tarislar is a rundown enclave of exiled elves from Tir Tairngire, where crumbling buildings and graffiti-covered walls tell the story of a once-proud community now living in squalor. Despite their exile and hardship, the elves maintain a tight-knit culture, relying on underground networks and subtle influence to survive in the harsh urban sprawl of Puyallup, while quietly resisting the forces that would keep them marginalized.

### Delreadh An Tuarthell (The Silver Hall) — Elven Cultural Sanctuary

Caretaker: Elder Faelenia, a stern and dignified matriarch who still clings to the ideals of elven nobility.

Once a grand center of elven power, now a weathered monument to lost glory, the Silver Hall is where the enclave’s remaining leaders gather to discuss the fate of Tarislar. Elders and spiritual leaders use this space for clandestine meetings and rituals, though it’s often haunted by ghosts of the past and disputes over direction.

Tension: Those who enter seeking favors or support are subjected to a test of loyalty to the old ways, with few leaving unchanged.

### Daisy Chain — Underground Smuggling & Escape Route

Operator: Sian Drayr, an unassuming but cunning elf with a hand in everything from smuggling to blackmail.

A vast network of hidden passageways, safehouses, and secret trade routes beneath Tarislar. The Daisy Chain connects the enclave’s scattered inhabitants, allowing them to move freely without detection by gangs, Yakuza, or corporate surveillance. It’s also a lifeline for smuggling illicit goods and people in and out of the enclave.

Warning: The tunnels are riddled with traps and ambushes—only those who know the right paths survive.

### The Gilded Shade — Nightclub & Black Market Bazaar

Owner: Lysia Ren, a former elven simstar turned nightclub mogul, with her fingers in every illicit pie in Tarislar.

A neon-lit hotspot where the elite of Tarislar mingle with the criminal underworld. The Gilded Shade is both a nightclub and a black-market bazaar where everything from magical artifacts to corporate secrets can be bought and sold under the table. The music is loud, the drinks are strong, and the deals are often dirtier than they appear.

Warning: Visitors who aren’t careful with their words or deals may find themselves as part of the club’s entertainment—or worse.

### The Fallen Spire — Radical Elven Gathering Spot

Caretaker: Varyn Ardan, a firebrand elf who’s quickly gaining a following among the disenfranchised youth.

Once the seat of Tarislar’s leadership, now a half-collapsed ruin home to the radical Free Thinkers. The Fallen Spire serves as both a base of operations and a battleground for ideological war, as elves who have rejected tradition meet to plot their uprising. It’s a place where whispers of revolution echo in the broken halls, and the idea of reclaiming Tarislar’s lost honor is spread through fervent speeches and guerilla tactics.

Danger: Those who cross the Free Thinkers often find themselves the target of sabotage or public shaming.

### The Crystal Market — Black Market & Magical Goods Exchange

Operator: Karissa Vael, a sharp-tongued elf who’s rumored to have connections to megacorps and organized crime.

An open-air marketplace where elves trade everything from enchanted jewelry to stolen corporate tech. The Crystal Market is a chaotic blend of chaos and opportunity, a place where the desperate seek out what they need and the cunning make their fortunes. From magical trinkets to black-market bioware, you can find almost anything here—for the right price.

Danger: The market is filled with counterfeit goods, and a wrong move can get you on the wrong side of both the vendors and the local gangs.

### The Hollowed Wood — Elven Spiritual Sanctuary

Caretaker: Elandra Tirwen, an enigmatic mystic elf who is the spiritual guide for Tarislar’s few remaining druids.

A secluded and tranquil forest hidden deep within Tarislar, the Hollowed Wood is one of the last places where the elves commune with the spirits of their ancestors and the ancient forces of nature. This sacred space is used for healing, ritual, and meditation, offering a brief respite from the hardships of daily life in the enclave. The trees seem to whisper secrets of the past, and those who enter with pure intentions often leave feeling more whole.

Warning: The Hollowed Wood is sacred, and outsiders who seek to exploit its energies are not welcome.

# RULES

## Character Creation

### ATTRIBUTES

To generate a character’s attributes, roll 3d6 six times and assign the results in order to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.

If you prefer not to roll, you may instead assign the following scores to your attributes in any order you wish: 14, 12, 11, 10, 9, and 7. If you assign your scores, you cannot replace one of them with a 14.

### BACKGROUND

To determine your hero’s past experience, you need to choose or roll a background.

First, you get the free skill associated with the background.

Next, you may either pick two other skills from the Learning table for your background, or make three random rolls divided between the Growth and Learning tables.

If you pick skills, you can select exactly the talents you want for your hero, while going with random rolls allows your character a little wider range of competence and the option of attribute improvements at the cost of perfect control over their development. If you pick skills, you may pick the same skill twice if you wish, to improve its starting proficiency.

No operator can start with a skill level above level-1.

Rolls on the Growth table that improve your basic attributes can boost them up to a maximum of 18.

If the bonus is +2, you may split the points between two different attributes of the appropriate type if you wish.

As a general rule, Contacts won’t go on missions with the PCs.

### CONTACTS

You start play knowing either two Acquaintances or one Friend.

Acquaintances, who know you and will work with you reliably, and Friends, who can be expected to go the extra mile for you.

### EDGES

Every PC picks two Edges when they create their character.

### Elf

Strong Attribute: DEX +1 bonus modifier, CHA +1 bonus modifier, CON -1 negative modifier

Useful Immunity: Aging


### Dwarf

Strong Attribute: CON +1 bonus modifier, WIS +1 bonus modifier, DEX -1 negative modifier

Innate Ability:  Hemosynthetic Filter System (CwoN pg 62), Eye Mod/Infrared (CwoN pg. 72)


### Orc

Strong Attribute: STR +2 bonus modifier, CON +1 bonus modifier, INT -1 negative modifier, CHA -1 negative modifier

Aptitude for Violence (SwoN pg 209)

### Troll

Strong Attribute: STR +2 bonus modifier, CON +2 bonus modifier, INT -1 negative modifier, WIS -1 negative modifier, CHA -1 negative modifier

Tough (SwoN pg 209)

### Spellcaster

You are a mage, capable of casting spells as described in section 6.1.0 and suffering a mage’s limits in using cyberware.

### Summoner

You are a summoner, capable of calling up spirit servants as described in section 6.2.0, though you also have limits in using cyberware.

### Graced

You have innate magical abilities that enhance your physical or mental prowess. You gain the Graced powers and hindrances described in section 6.3.0.

## FOCI

A beginning PC can pick one Focus. If you’ve taken the Focused Edge, you can make a second pick, or take the second level of your initial Focus. You’ll gain additional Focus picks as you rise in character level.

## HIT POINTS

Novice operators roll 1d6 to determine their starting hit points, to which they add their Constitution modifier.

## ATTACK BONUS

For a novice PC, their attack bonus is +0. If you’ve taken the On Target Edge, then your starting attack bonus is +1.

## SAVING THROWS

Physical saves are made when your PC tries to resist poison, endure exhaustion, fight off a physical effect, or withstand bodily suffering. You subtract the better of your Strength or Constitution modifiers from your Physical save target.

Evasion saves are made when your PC tries to pull back from a yawning pit, dive out of a grenade blast, catch a plunging comrade, or otherwise use quick reflexes to avert some catastrophe. You subtract the better of your Intelligence or Dexterity modifiers from your Evasion save target.

Mental saves are made when your PC tries to resist neurological hacking, fight off mental effects, or avoid psychological harm. You subtract the better of your Wisdom or Charisma modifiers from your Mental save target.

Luck saves are made when only blind luck can influence the outcome of a danger, and your only hope is that Death is looking for someone else. No attribute modifies your save target.

## STARTING GEAR

A novice PC has $500 to purchase gear from the equipment tables starting on page 50, plus one single item worth no more than $1,000, such as a rifle for a hitman, a scrap cyberdeck for a hacker, or some other tool of their trade. Their recent work has been profitable enough to have paid for one month of a middle-class lifestyle as explained on page 51. After that month, they’re on their own for making rent and avoiding poverty.

## FINAL TOUCHES

### Pick a FREE Bonus Skill

Most of a character’s skills come from their background, Edges, and Foci, but there’s always room for a little personal development. You can pick one skill of your choice to gain at level-0, or at level-1 if you already have it at level-0. You can’t pick a skill that you already have at level-1.

### Record Weapons and Armor

### Choose Starting Languages

Characters begin with fluency in their city’s most common language and the native language of their particular ethnic enclave or separate society, if that’s a different tongue.

PCs also have fluency in additional languages based on their Connect and Know skill levels. Level-0 in either grants one more language and level-1 grants two.

Increasing Connect or Know skills later can allow them to learn one more language for each level they gain, as can spending a few months immersed in a culture.

## SAVING THROWS

To make a saving throw, a person rolls 1d20 and tries to get equal or higher than their saving throw target. Sometimes a save might have bonuses or penalties applied to the roll, but a natural roll of 1 on the die always fails the save, and a natural roll of 20 is always a success.

## SKILL CHECKS

To make a skill check, roll 2d6 and add the most relevant skill level and attribute modifier. If the total is equal or higher than the check’s difficulty, the check is a success.

If the character doesn’t even have level-0 in the pertinent skill, they suffer a -1 penalty to the roll.

## COMBAT

"Death is always close on the streets."
