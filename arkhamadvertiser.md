Tech level 0 - represents a world with technologies similar to neolithic-era humanity.

Tech level 1 - worlds have managed to find and exploit metal deposits and likely have imported or domesticated beasts of burden.

Tech level 2 - worlds are blessed with the presence of fossil fuels or a feasibly abundant biofuel source.

Tech level 3 - worlds are those that have developed to a level much like that of the more advanced nations of late twentieth-century Earth.

Tech level 4 - worlds are the most common in human space, and their technical expertise is the baseline for modern post-FTL societies or “postech”.

Tech level 5 - worlds with this level of technological expertise has somehow managed to hold on to the majority of the post-FTL technology base, and can produce a wide range of goods that are unknown on less sophisticated worlds. (USC's Tech level at the fall)

Tech level 6 - ???

# RULES

## Character Creation

## ATTRIBUTES

To generate a character’s attributes, roll 3d6 six times and assign the results in order to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.

If you prefer not to roll, you may instead assign the following scores to your attributes in any order you wish: 14, 12, 11, 10, 9, and 7. If you assign your scores, you cannot replace one of them with a 14.

## BACKGROUND

To determine your hero’s past experience, you need to choose or roll a background.

First, you get the free skill associated with the background.

Next, you may either pick two other skills from the Learning table for your background, or make three random rolls divided between the Growth and Learning tables.

If you pick skills, you can select exactly the talents you want for your hero, while going with random rolls allows your character a little wider range of competence and the option of attribute improvements at the cost of perfect control over their development. If you pick skills, you may pick the same skill twice if you wish, to improve its starting proficiency.

No personnel can start with a skill level above level-1.

Rolls on the Growth table that improve your basic attributes can boost them up to a maximum of 18.

If the bonus is +2, you may split the points between two different attributes of the appropriate type if you wish.

## Class

Choose your class, representing those talents you have that are most relevant to an adventurer’s lifestyle. If your hero isn’t well-described by Warrior, Expert, or Psychic, you can choose Adventurer and mix your class abilities.

## FOCI

Choose your foci, representing the side talents or particular specializations of your hero. You can pick one level of a focus of your choice. Characters with the Expert class or the Partial Expert feature of the Adventurer class get one level of a non-combat, non-psychic focus for free in addition to this. They can spend both levels on the same focus, starting with level 2 in it if they wish. Characters with the Warrior class or Partial Warrior feature of the Adventurer class can do the same in choosing one level of a combat focus.

### XENOBIOLOGY

No, there is not a direct translation from Dark Reaches to SWN, but I've done the best that I can. If anyone has a suggestion or request, let me know. :D

### Origin Foci: Heavy Worlder

You come from a heavygravity world: Strength Is Forged in Gravity.

Strong Attribute: +1 STR (max +3 modifier).

Origin Skill (Exert): Gain a level of Exert. If you already have Exert at 0+, increase it by +1 level instead (max per usual limits).

Drawback — Low-G Maladaptation:
In microgravity or on a lowgravity world without mag-boots or tailored harnesses, you suffer –1 AC, –1 to attack rolls, and –1 to Dex-based skill checks/Evasion saves. After 24 hours (or with gear), reduce this penalty to –1 to Dex-based skill checks only.

### Origin Foci: Chigru

You come from one of the vast Chigru colonies: Unity in Diversity, Strength in Numbers

Natural Defenses: While unarmored, you have AC 13 (does not stack with worn armor). You also possess built-in melee weapons (claws/mandibles) that deal 1d6 damage, using Punch or Stab.

Innate Ability — Tetramanipulation: You have four prehensile limbs. Once per round, you may perform an extra minor manipulation (draw/stow/reload/activate) that doesn’t consume your Main Action. You gain +1 on Exert checks to climb, maintain holds, or resist/escape grapples.

Drawback — Ectothermic Physiology:
In cold environments without heated gear, you suffer –1 to attack rolls and skill checks. In severe cold, make Physical saves per hour or suffer environmental damage as normal.

### Origin Foci: Kzinti

You come from one of the pack worlds of the Kzinti: For an Honor Greater Than Ourselves

Strong Attribute: Choose either DEX or INT at character creation; that attribute gains +1 (max +3 modifier).

Innate Ability — Predator Senses: You ignore dim-light penalties (low-light vision). You also gain Notice-0. If you already have Notice, you instead get +1 to Notice checks relying on hearing or smell.

Drawback — Overtuned Senses:
You are vulnerable to flash/sonic overload. You suffer –2 on saves versus flashbangs, stun-sonics, deafening blasts, or blinding arcs. On a failed save, you are dazzled (–1 to attack rolls and skill checks) for 1d3 rounds. Proper visors/ear dampers negate this.

### Origin Foci: Genetically Augmented

Your parents were jailed for genetically modifying you in the womb: Perfection Is a Burden We Bear.

Strong Attribute: Choose any attribute at character creation; that attribute gains +1 (max +3 modifier).

Useful Immunity (minor): You are immune to diseases and poisons.

Drawback — Social Stigma:
You were raised under state control, marked as dangerous. Others distrust Augments. NPC reaction rolls start one category worse unless the NPC already respects Augments. In addition, you must choose at character creation whether your flaw manifests as Arrogance or Neurosis — this should guide your roleplay.

### Origin Foci: Zendai

You are descended from the original homo-superiors created by the legendary Drago Ivani: Perfection is destiny.

Strong Attribute: Choose either INT or CHA at character creation; that attribute gains +1 (max +3 modifier).

Origin Skill: You gain Lead-0 or Sneak-0 (your choice).

Drawback — Hubris:
Zendai arrogance and treachery are legendary. NPC reaction rolls toward you start one category worse unless the NPC is another Zendai or deeply impressed by your superiority. In addition, when acting against your family/descendants, you suffer disadvantage (roll twice, take worse) on all relevant checks — Zendai love their children fiercely.

### Wired

You’re professionally chromed. You start play with a vetted suite of cyberware and the know-how to keep it running. You may begin play with up to $50,000 worth of SWN cyber (May be expanded later). 

INT/Fix @ 8+ — routine upkeep, calibration, swapping parts.

Software/firmware-heavy systems: INT/Program @ 8+.

Bio-integration/tissue issues: INT/Heal @ 8+ (often alongside Fix).

## NON-PSYCHIC SKILL

Now pick one non-psychic skill

## PSIONICS (IF APPLICABLE) 

SWN, pg 29

## HIT POINTS

Roll your maximum hit points on 1d6, adding your Constitution modifier. Even a penalty can’t reduce your hit points below 1. Warrior PCs and Adventurers with the Partial Warrior class option add 2 points to this total. Hit points indicate how close your hero is to being defeated.

## ATTACK BONUS

For a novice PC, their attack bonus is +0. If you’ve taken the On Target Edge, then your starting attack bonus is +1.

## STARTING GEAR

Choose one of the equipment packages on page 25 or roll 2d6 x 100 to find out how many starting credits you have with which to buy gear.

## ARMOR CLASS

Different suits of armor grant different Armor Classes; ifyou aren’t wearing any armor at all, your base AC is 10. Add your Dexterity modifier to this.

## SAVING THROWS

Physical saves against poison, disease, or exhaustion are 15 minus the best of your Strength or Constitution modifiers. Evasion saves to dodge sudden perils or dive away from explosives are 15 minus the best of your Intelligence and Dexterity modifiers. Mental saves to resist psychic influence or mind-bending technology are 15 minus the best of your Wisdom or Charisma modifiers. To resist these perils, you need to equal or beat the save on a d20.

## SAVING THROWS

To make a saving throw, a person rolls 1d20 and tries to get equal or higher than their saving throw target. Sometimes a save might have bonuses or penalties applied to the roll, but a natural roll of 1 on the die always fails the save, and a natural roll of 20 is always a success.

## SKILL CHECKS

To make a skill check, roll 2d6 and add the most relevant skill level and attribute modifier. If the total is equal or higher than the check’s difficulty, the check is a success.

If the character doesn’t even have level-0 in the pertinent skill, they suffer a -1 penalty to the roll.
