# Prologue: Dark Schemes

Augustus Larkin, and his "personal aid" Luis de Mendoza, sought out explorers/archeologists/financiers for his expedition to locate a lost civilization in Peru. The ragtag group met in Lima, and were introduced to Jackson Elias (AKA Jessie Hughs), a published writer out of New York City, and Assistant Professor Eleanor Butler, a history professor from Miskatonic University.

The group soon learns that not everything is as it seems, and the hints of the kharisiri "vampires" are running rampant through the local area and of an *El Padre de los Gusados* or "Father of Maggots" seems to slowly bubble to the top of the rumor mill. Are Vampires even real? 

Confronting Larkin and Mendoza at a lost pyramid near Lake Titicaca, a fierce battle rages between the two groups. "Dear God, TOHIL, save us!" 

Unfortunately, Sadie Winchester, the meta-physical practitioner from New York, is lost to madness and kills herself, possibly keeping *El Padre de los Gusados* from inhabiting a host and freeing the "Father of Maggots" onto the world. 

As the dust settles, Mendoza and the other "vampires" were turned to ash, and Larkin, being gravely injured during the fight, seems to have vanished. 

The survivors stayed at the pyramid to bury it, completely, hopefully ending the threat of *El Padre de los Gusados* it for all time. 

During the month, Eleanor mentioned someone who may be able to help with other adventures, if the group was interested, a Mr. Green, Professor of Astrology at Miskatonic University.

# RULES

## LUCK

Luck rolls may be called for by the Keeper when circumstances external to any investigator are in question, and also when determining the fickle hand of fate. If a skill or characteristic is applicable to a situation then it should be used rather than Luck. 

If the Keeper calls for a Group Luck roll, the player whose investigator has the lowest Luck score, among those present in the scene, should make the roll. 

IF something bad is deemed to happen to one member of the group, the Keeper can simply ask who has the lowest Luck score at that moment and have that individual suffer the unfortunate event. 

---

## USING LUCK

### Adjusting Skill or Characteristic Rolls

Cost: 1 for 1 basis

After the player has made a skill roll (using a skill or characteristic), Luck points may be spent to alter the result. The player can use Luck points to alter a roll on a 1 for 1 basis. The amount of Luck points that can be spent in this manner is limited only by the character's available Luck score.

### Adjusting Weapon Fumble or Firearm Malfunction Outcomes

Cost: 10 Luck

When a roll indicates a melee weapon fumble or a firearms malfunction, 10 Luck points may be spent to ignore the result. The actual die roll result is not adjusted and the attack is still a failure. Luck is spent to avoid the dire consequences of the roll, allowing the hero to avoid a weapon breaking or a firearm jamming, and so on. 

### Halving Sanity Loss

Cost: double the Sanity points loss

When a Sanity roll has been failed, the number of Sanity points lost may be halved by spending Luck points equal to double the Sanity loss. For example, a hero is about to lose 8 Sanity points from seeing a horror from beyond. The hero spends 16 Luck points in total, reducing the loss from 8 to 4 points. 

### Avoiding Unconsciousness

Cost: 1 Luck point, doubles each round thereafter

Whenever a hero fails a CON roll to remain conscious, or if they suffer automatic unconsciousness, they may spend 1 Luck point to remain conscious until the end of the current round. For each successive round thereafter that the hero wishes to remain conscious, the cost doubles -2, 4, 8, 16, and so on- and should be spent at the start fo each round.

As soon as their Luck points run out or if they no longer wish to spend Luck, they immediately fall unconscious. This is a mixed blessing, as an active character may present a more attractive target for further damage.

### It's Only a Scratch!

Cost: 20 Luck

Wounds can sometimes look a lot worse than they actually are. Pulp heroes are able to call upon their inner reserves and gain an instant health boost to reduce damage they have received. When damage has been taken, a hero may spend 20 Luck points to gain an immediate 1d6 hit points recovery. Hit Points gained may not exceed the hero's maximum hit points total. 

In some situations, this may bring a hero back from the brink of death or simply give them an adrenaline rush to shake off their injuries and get on with the job in hand. The Keeper may also allow this health gain to provide faster recovery for a severely injured hero. 

### Avoiding Certain Death

Cost: all Luck points, 30 points minimum spend required

If a hero has 30+ Luck points remaining, all of these Luck points may be spent to bring a hero back form the brink of death. The hero has avoided certain death and immediately regains 1d6+1 hit points, turning up in the next scene in an appropriate state. 

---

## LUCK RECOVERY

At the start of each session of play, each player makes a Luck Recovery roll. This is rolled in the same way as for normal skill improvement. The player rolls 1d100 and if the roll is higher than their current Luck score they add 2d10+10 points to their Luck score. IF the roll is equal to or less than the hero's present Luck score, 1d10+5 Luck points are recovered. 

Naturally, a hero's Luck score will vary throughout play, but may never exceed 99. The starting Luck value is not used again in the game and can be exceeded in the course of play. 

---

## CRITICAL SUCCESSES AND FUMBLES

A critical success only arises from a natural dice roll of "01." Should Luck points be used to lower a roll to 01 the result is always an Extreme success, rather than a critical one. The only exception to this would be in combat where two opponents have tied, both scoring Extreme success, if one uses Luck to lower their combat roll to"01" it means thay they beat their opponent's level of success, treat the result as an Extreme success though. 

As with standard *Call of Cthulhu*, a naturally rolled critical success always means something beneficial has happened, determined by the Keeper and the situation at hand. Likewise, a natural fumble, or "100", means something bad has happened. Note thaty while Luck can be used to avoid the effects of a fumble or malfunction in combat, for non-combat skills a natural fumble cannot be avoided!

## INTELLIGENCE ROLLS AND IDEA ROLLS

An INT roll may be called for by the Keeper when a hero is attempting to solve an intellectual puzzle of some kind. By rolling equal to or below the hero's INT, the player will receive a solution from the Keeper. This might include solving a crossword puzzle or answering a riddle. 

### Idea Roll

An *Idea* roll is different to an INT roll, although made in the same manner by rolling equal to or below the hero's INT characteristic. An Idea roll is usually proposed by the players when their investigators have become stuck at a point in the investigation; perhaps they have completely missed a vital clue, or just don't know wheat to do next, and so the game has been stalled. The outcome of the Idea roll will get the investigation back on track; however, the success or failure of the Idea roll determines whether the missed clue has been obtained easily, or at some cost to the investigators.

### Know Roll

All people know bits of information about different topics. The *Know* roll represents what's stored in the brain's intellectual attic, calculated as the percentage chance that the investigator's education supplied the information. Roll equal to or under a character's EDU value to determine the success of a *Know* roll. 

The investigator might know it is dangerous to pour water into sulfuric acid, without studying Science: Chemistry, or be able to remember the geography of Tibet, without a Navigate roll, or know how many legs arachnids have, and possess only one percentile of Biology. 

Identification of present-day earthly languages is an excellent use for the *Know* roll. IF a specific skill is more applicable to the situation, then it should be used rather than making a *Know* roll, of course, at the Keeper's discretion.

## INSANITY

### Temporary Insanity

If an investigator loses 5 or more Sanity points from a single source of Sanity loss, sufficient emotional trauma has been suffered that the Keeper **must** test the investigators sanity. The Keeper asks for an INT roll. If the roll is failed, the investigator has repressed the memory, a trick the mind uses to protect itself, and does not become insane. Perversely, if the INT roll succeeds, the investigator recognizes the full significance of what has been seen or experienced and goes temporarily insane. The effects of temporary insanity begin immediately and lasts for 1d10 hours. 

### Indefinite Insanity

On losing one fifth "1/5" or more of current Sanity points in one game "day" the investigator becomes indefinitely insane. No investigator is simply able to shrug off this amount of sanity drain. A "day" in this instance is defined by the Keeper, usually lasting until the investigator reaches a place of safety in which they can rest and recover their wits. Depending on the situation, it may mean surviving until dawn, sitting down for a nice cup of tea, or having a good night's sleep. Indefinite insanity lasts until the character is cured or recovers.

### Permanent Insanity

When Sanity points are reduced to zero the investigator is permanently and incurably insane and ceases to be a player character. In the real world, all insanity is indefinite insanity, since no one in real life can hope to predict the future as accurately as a *Call of Cthulhu* Keeper can. 

Many disorders, especially congenital conditions, offer little hope of recovery. Lovecraft concludes more than one story with the intimation that a lifetime of madness for the narrator will follow. 

Every Keeper must work out what the end-point of madness is in the game. Now and then a quiet release might be made from a local asylum. Some thin, unnaturally pallid person, almost unrecognizable after soul-wracking terrors, can walk shyly into downtown. Arkham or elsewhere, cast keen eyes about, and attempt to regain some semblance of his or her former life - however, no player should count on such privilege as a right.
