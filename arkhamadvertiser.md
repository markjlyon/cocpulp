# RULES

## Character Creation

### ATTRIBUTES

To generate a character’s attributes, roll 3d6 six times and assign the results in order to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.

If you prefer not to roll, you may instead assign the following scores to your attributes in any order you wish: 14, 12, 11, 10, 9, and 7. If you assign your scores, you cannot replace one of them with a 14.

### BACKGROUND

To determine your hero’s past experience, you need to choose or roll a background.

First, you get the free skill associated with the background.

Next, you may either pick two other skills from the Learning table for your background, or make three random rolls divided between the Growth and Learning tables.

If you pick skills, you can select exactly the talents you want for your hero, while going with random rolls allows your character a little wider range of competence and the option of attribute improvements at the cost of perfect control over their development. If you pick skills, you may pick the same skill twice if you wish, to improve its starting proficiency.

No operator can start with a skill level above level-1.

Rolls on the Growth table that improve your basic attributes can boost them up to a maximum of 18.

If the bonus is +2, you may split the points between two different attributes of the appropriate type if you wish.

As a general rule, Contacts won’t go on missions with the PCs.

### CONTACTS

You start play knowing either two Acquaintances or one Friend.

Acquaintances, who know you and will work with you reliably, and Friends, who can be expected to go the extra mile for you.

### EDGES

Every PC picks two Edges when they create their character.

### Elf

Strong Attribute: DEX +1 bonus modifier, CHA +1 bonus modifier, CON -1 negative modifier

Useful Immunity: Aging


### Dwarf

Strong Attribute: CON +1 bonus modifier, WIS +1 bonus modifier, DEX -1 negative modifier

Innate Ability:  Hemosynthetic Filter System (CwoN pg 62), Eye Mod/Infrared (CwoN pg. 72)


### Orc

Strong Attribute: STR +2 bonus modifier, CON +1 bonus modifier, INT -1 negative modifier, CHA -1 negative modifier

Aptitude for Violence (SwoN pg 209)

### Troll

Strong Attribute: STR +2 bonus modifier, CON +2 bonus modifier, INT -1 negative modifier, WIS -1 negative modifier, CHA -1 negative modifier

Tough (SwoN pg 209)

## FOCI

A beginning PC can pick one Focus. If you’ve taken the Focused Edge, you can make a second pick, or take the second level of your initial Focus. You’ll gain additional Focus picks as you rise in character level.

## HIT POINTS

Novice operators roll 1d6 to determine their starting hit points, to which they add their Constitution modifier.

## ATTACK BONUS

For a novice PC, their attack bonus is +0. If you’ve taken the On Target Edge, then your starting attack bonus is +1.

## SAVING THROWS

Physical saves are made when your PC tries to resist poison, endure exhaustion, fight off a physical effect, or withstand bodily suffering. You subtract the better of your Strength or Constitution modifiers from your Physical save target.

Evasion saves are made when your PC tries to pull back from a yawning pit, dive out of a grenade blast, catch a plunging comrade, or otherwise use quick reflexes to avert some catastrophe. You subtract the better of your Intelligence or Dexterity modifiers from your Evasion save target.

Mental saves are made when your PC tries to resist neurological hacking, fight off mental effects, or avoid psychological harm. You subtract the better of your Wisdom or Charisma modifiers from your Mental save target.

Luck saves are made when only blind luck can influence the outcome of a danger, and your only hope is that Death is looking for someone else. No attribute modifies your save target.

## STARTING GEAR

A novice PC has $500 to purchase gear from the equipment tables starting on page 50, plus one single item worth no more than $1,000, such as a rifle for a hitman, a scrap cyberdeck for a hacker, or some other tool of their trade. Their recent work has been profitable enough to have paid for one month of a middle-class lifestyle as explained on page 51. After that month, they’re on their own for making rent and avoiding poverty.

## FINAL TOUCHES

### Pick a FREE Bonus Skill

Most of a character’s skills come from their background, Edges, and Foci, but there’s always room for a little personal development. You can pick one skill of your choice to gain at level-0, or at level-1 if you already have it at level-0. You can’t pick a skill that you already have at level-1.

### Record Weapons and Armor

### Choose Starting Languages

Characters begin with fluency in their city’s most common language and the native language of their particular ethnic enclave or separate society, if that’s a different tongue.

PCs also have fluency in additional languages based on their Connect and Know skill levels. Level-0 in either grants one more language and level-1 grants two.

Increasing Connect or Know skills later can allow them to learn one more language for each level they gain, as can spending a few months immersed in a culture.

## SAVING THROWS

To make a saving throw, a person rolls 1d20 and tries to get equal or higher than their saving throw target. Sometimes a save might have bonuses or penalties applied to the roll, but a natural roll of 1 on the die always fails the save, and a natural roll of 20 is always a success.

## SKILL CHECKS

To make a skill check, roll 2d6 and add the most relevant skill level and attribute modifier. If the total is equal or higher than the check’s difficulty, the check is a success.

If the character doesn’t even have level-0 in the pertinent skill, they suffer a -1 penalty to the roll.
